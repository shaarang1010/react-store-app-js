You can access the api below. Also, available is postman collection.

[Fake-Store-API](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs)

#### STR-US3. As a user, when I click on a product on the dashboard, it should me the details of the product

Acceptance criteria:

1. A user clicks on a product image on the dashboard.
2. The user is navigated to the products page where the product image, title, descritpion, category and price are shown.
3. A button `Add to cart` is shown below the product details.
4. When the user clicks on the `Add to cart` button, the product is added to the user's cart. _(This functionality can be either mocked or you can implement this via React Context API)_

**Option 1: Mock the functionality [Complexity: Easy]**

- Make an api call to fake-store-api to add new product to the cart as shown [here](https://fakestoreapi.com/docs#c-new).
- Store the response and either show it as a modal or an alert (you can use React-Bootstrap [Modal](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/modal/) or [Alert](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/alerts/) components).
- On clicking back, the user should be navigated back to dashboard.

**Option 2: Use Context API [Complexity: Hard]**

- Create a Context named - CartContext.
- CartContext should store array of Products.
- When a user adds product to cart, the product including its details should be added to the context.
- These details should persist when the user is navigated back to the dashboard
- [BONUS]: In the Navbar, you can display the total number of products in the cart.

#### STR-US4. As a user, I would like to sort products on dashboard in either accending or descending order\*\*

Acceptance criteria:

1. Add a dropdown, with options to Sort - ASC, Sort-DESC.
2. The dropdown should be added below the navbar and floated to right. You can use `flex justify-content-end` class or `float:right`.
3. When the user chooses `SORT-ASC` the products should be sorted by their price in ascending order. When user chooses `SORT-DESC` the products on dashboard should be sorted according to their prices in descending order.
